webfactory/legacy-integration-bundle
===================================

This bundle provides an approach to integrate existing legacy applications with
Symfony2.

In brief, the approach is to run a particular event listener on the kernel.controller
event. This event listener will decide whether and how to run the legacy application.
The response generated by the legacy application will then be captured.

Later, after the Symfony2 Controller has been executed and a Twig template is being
rendered, fragments of the "legacy response" can be retrieved and be used as part
of the output.

That way, you can start with your legacy applcation and Symfony2 in coexistence
next to each other. You can then incrementally start to shift functionality over
to the Symfony2 stack while maintaining a coherent user experience.

Because Symfony2 is driving this process and Twig templates have the control
authority of which parts of the legacy response are being used, this approach
will naturally "grow" away from the legacy application towards the Symfony2 stack.

*Take care:* This bundle currently uses webfactory/dom, a small set of utilities
  on top of PHP's DOM extension, to process the legacy application's repsonse and
  provide XPath-based access to it. It will only work if your old application
  returns well-formed XHTML or Polyglot HTML5.

To learn more about this concept, its benefits and caveats, use your time-machine
and visit the Symfony2 User Group Colone meeting on 2013-12-18.

Installation
---

Just like any other Symfony2 bundle, left as an exercise to the reader.

Configuration
---

```
webfactory_legacy_integration:
    # Whether your legacy application returns text/html as XHTML 1.0 or Polyglot HTML5.
    parsingMode: xhtml10|html5
    # Bootstrap file for the legacy application (see next section)
    legacyApplicationBootstrapFile: www/index-legacy.php
```

The legacy "bootstrap" file
---

You must provide a single file that can be `include()`ed in order to run your
legacy applcation. Typically you will already have this - it should be your
legacy application's front controller.

This file should _return_ the HTTP status code sent by the legacy application.
This is because the `http_response_code()` function is not available until PHP 5.4.

Also, as this bundle will try to capture the response including headers using
output buffering, you must not flush the response body or headers
to the client.

Using it
---

Once you're set up, use the @Dispatch annotation on your controller to run the
legacy application before your controller - like so:

```php
<?php
namespace Acme\My\Bundle\Controller;

use Webfactory\Bundle\LegacyIntegrationBundle\Integration\Annotation as Legacy;
use ...

class MyController ...
{
    /**
     * @Legacy\Dispatch
     */
    public function myAction()
    {
        return ...
    }
}
```

Once the legacy application has been run, you can use the Twig global `legacyApplication`
provided by the bundle to access parts of the response and place it in your views.

```twig
{# you_template.html.twig #}
<html>
    ...
    <body>
        ...
        <div id="content">
            {{ legacyApplication.xpath('//*[@id="content"]/*') | raw }}
        </div>
        ...
    </body>
</html>
```

Filters
---

The `LegacyApplicationDispatchingEventListener` can take a set of _Filters_ which
must implement the Webfactory\Bundle\LegacyIntegrationBundle\Integration\Filter interface.

Once the legacy application has been executed, all registered filters are passed
the `FilterControllerEvent` which triggered the event listener as well as the
`Response` object that was created for the legacy application.

The primary use case for this is to be able to examine the response and choose
to send it to the client as-is, bypassing execution of the Symfony2 controller.
That way, you can have routes/controllers in Symfony2 to trigger (or allow) the
execution of particular use-cases in your legacy application while still returning
its response unmodified initially.

You can use the `webfactory_legacy_integration.filter` tag to add more filters.
A more convenient way is the use of additional annotations as follows.

### Filter annotations

The `Webfactory\Bundle\LegacyIntegrationBundle\Integration\Annotation` namespace
contains a few annotations you can use in addition to the `@Legacy\Dispatch` annotation
described earlier.

In particular,

- @Legacy\Passthru will send the legacy application's response as-is, so the controller itself will never be run
- @Legacy\IgnoreRedirect will bypass the controller if the legacy application sent a Location: redirect header.
- @Legacy\IgnoreHeader("some-name") will bypass the controller if the legacy application sent "Some-Name:" header. This can be used to make the legacy application control execution of the Symfony2 controller (use with caution).

Integrate Symfony 1.4
---

To integrate a Symfony 1.4 project into Symfony2 with this bundle, the following changes need to be done:

### Symfony2 files

- in the app/config/config.yml file, preceed the path of the legacyApplicationBootstrapFile with ../ as shown below

```yml
webfactory_legacy_integration:
    # Whether your legacy application returns text/html as XHTML 1.0 or Polyglot HTML5.
    parsingMode: html5
    # Bootstrap file for the legacy application (see next section)
    legacyApplicationBootstrapFile: ../legacy/web/index_legacy.php
```

### Symfony 1.4 files

- create a directory named legacy in the root of the Symfony2 project
- copy all files from your Symfony 1.4 project into this new directory
- make sure the permissions of your Symfony 1.4 project files are set as needed (cache and log must be writable by apache, etc)
- if your Symfony 1.4 project has databases, make sure they're created and populated with neccesary data

### Notes

- you have to clear your cache in your Symfony2 AND your Symfony 1.4 project after you make changes that require a clear cache
- you have to create a new bundle and a new route with @Legacy\Dispatch and @Legacy\PassThru for each of your Symfony 1.4 route

### Swiftmailer conflict

When you test your project, you may run into an FatalErrorException because Symfony 1.4 is trying to redeclare the Swift class; both your Symfony 1.4 and Symfony2 have SwiftMailer. A workaround is to remove SwiftMailer from Symfony 1.4:

- in the legacy/lib/vendor/symfony/lib/config/sfFactoryConfigHandler.class.php file, on line 44, comment out the 'mailer' element from the $factories array as shown below:

```php
// available list of factories
$factories = array('view_cache_manager', 'logger', 'i18n', 'controller', 'request', 'response', 'routing', 'storage', 'user', 'view_cache');//, 'mailer');
```

- clear both your Symfony 1.4 and Symfony2 cache, and run your application again

Bugs
---

We've used this bundle successfully to slowly migrate a couple of applications
and projects to the Symfony2 stack. Yet it deserves a little more love, fine-polishing,
and documentation. Feel free to open PRs or open issues for it to express your
interest in it.

Oh, and unit tests would be fine :)
